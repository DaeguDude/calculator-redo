Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit,
each of the above functions and an “Equals”, “Clear”, “dot”,
“parenthesis”.

✔ Have you decided what to use to make a layout for calculator? @done(20-06-30 10:33)
Grid, but the problem is I don’t really know well about
how to set the proper width and align these buttons well 
using Grid. I have to look up how to align items using Grid. 
And give it a proper width that I want it to have.
