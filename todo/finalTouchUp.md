Okay, I have reached to the almost at the end of the project!
Now there are few things that I need to go and fix.

## Things to Improve

<!-- 1. When number, operator, enter, deciaml whatever is being typed, it 
needs to show some effect to prove that they are actually being processed otherwise you won't really know when you click the operator or press the enter. -->

<!-- 2. When number is negative, or has a decimal value, text direction is reversed so it looks weird -->

3. A little bit of responsive design
    - Make it fit to the laptop at least

4. Calculation Logic Error
    - Division by zero doesn't seem to work
        - After that division, number '0' is prefixed
