Okay, I have reached to the almost at the end of the project!
Now there are few things that I need to go and fix.

## Things to Improve

<!-- 1. When number, operator, enter, deciaml whatever is being typed, it 
needs to show some effect to prove that they are actually being processed otherwise you won't really know when you click the operator or press the enter. -->

<!-- 2. When number is negative, or has a decimal value, text direction is reversed so it looks weird -->

3. A little bit of responsive design
    - Make it fit to the laptop at least
        - How will you keep the calculator ratio?
            - Figure out Calculator Size
            - Figure out Display & Number Section size
            - Button size
        - Header
            - Header text, icons need to have some margin
            or padding
            - Different Color than Yellow

    1. Need to keep the calculator ratio even if it gets smaller,
    just size changes
        - Figure out calculator ratio and size
        - Display & number section size
        - button size
            - grid-template -columns
            - grid-template-rows

    2. Header size
        - header text, icons need to have some margin on padding
        to be in the middle whole time
        - different header color

4. Calculation Logic Error
    - When media query is applied...
        - Number se

    - Division by zero doesn't seem to work
        - After that division, number '0' is prefixed
