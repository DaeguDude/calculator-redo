EXTRA CREDIT: Users can get floating point numbers if they do the
math required to get one, but they can't type them in yet.
Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don't
let them type more than one though: 12.356.5. It's hard to do
math on these numbers.(disable the decimal button if there's already
one in the display)
