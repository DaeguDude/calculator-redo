6-2 You should round answers so they don't overflow the screen

6-3 Pressing '=' before entering all of the numbers or an
operator could cause problems!

    - What problems can it cause?
        - Without any first & second number, if user presses
        an equal key, it will show NaN

    - I need to check if there are 2 numbers to be operated on
    when equal key is pressed
