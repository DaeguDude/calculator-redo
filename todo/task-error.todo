// ERROR FIX TODO

When I click the operator, if there's 2 numbers and 1 operator to operate
on those numbers, it should calculate the values regarding to the operator

task 6-6-1 when you click the opeartor, if there's already 2 numbers
and 1 operator put in the those variables, you should just calculate
it and put the last operator into the operator variable again.
And the answer should be a first Number to be calculated for the next
calculation.
