# The Odin Project - Calculator

In this project, we are going to make a calculator that can perform basic
operations. Besides from making this thing work, in this project, there is one 
particular thing that I really want to practice. [PROBLEM SOLVING](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/problem-solving-javascript).

I will follow this problem solving skills before I tackle any of the problems that I will have encountered.

Here's the link to my calculator. It's not really design friendly and have some minor bugs, so if you can tell me that I'd appreciate it.
