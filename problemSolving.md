## Problem Solving 

1. Understand the Problem:
    - Write down the problem on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes
    sense to you
    - Draw diagrams if that helps

2. Plan
    - Write down the exact steps(Algorithm)
    - Write down comments for each step(Pseudocode)

3. Divide into sub-problems
    - Break down a big problem into sub-problems
    - Find the simplest(You already know the answer)
    - Make sure your sub-problem being-solved doesn't depend on others being
    solved
    - Connect the dot after you finishing all sub-problems

4. Stuck?
    - Don't be irritated, be curious
    - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where
    you went wrong.
    - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective
    - Research: Look for a solution in Google. Don't look for a solution for big
    problems, but sub-problems. That's how you learn.
